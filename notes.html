    <h1>What I Did</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>I created an app that uses the data of the first 151 pokemon on the PokeAPI, and it is organized by number.</li>
        <li>I tried to make sure the CSS looked neat, worked properly, and fit the Project</li>
        <li>I added a way to click a pokemon and get the front sprite of the pokemon, however I was unable to get the back sprite, but I think what I was able to do is better. As I was able to change the original Pokemon Logo image into the pokemon.</li>
    </ol>
